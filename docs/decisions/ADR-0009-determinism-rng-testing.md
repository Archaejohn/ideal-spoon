# ADR-0009: Determinism, RNG & testing strategy

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-06-30
- **Deciders:** Architect, Owner

## Context

`CONTRIBUTING.md` and `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` #9 require deterministic core logic (seeded RNG) and
thorough, meaningful unit tests — **≥80% on non-UI logic modules**, full GUT suite green in CI. Saves
(ADR-0005) and ending replays (ADR-0006) must be **reproducible**, which only works if all randomness
flows through a single seeded service whose state is saved. This ADR fixes the RNG design, the
determinism guarantees, and the concrete GUT test layout and must-test list.

## Options considered

1. **Ad-hoc `randi()`/`randf()` global calls wherever randomness is needed.** Non-deterministic, not
   restorable, impossible to reproduce a battle or replay; untestable. Rejected.
2. **One `RandomNumberGenerator` shared globally.** Better, but a single cursor shared across battle,
   loot, and UI flavor means unrelated draws perturb each other and break reproducibility when, say,
   an animation also rolls. Rejected.
3. **A single `RngService` that vends named, independently-seeded substreams, with per-stream cursors
   saved.** Deterministic, reproducible, isolates concerns, and is the injectable unit tests need.
   Chosen.

## Decision

### The RNG service

`core/rng_service.gd` (autoload) owns one `master_seed` (set at New Game, saved in `GameState`). It
derives **named substreams** so unrelated systems don't perturb each other:

```gdscript
func seed_run(master_seed: int) -> void
func stream(name: String) -> RngStream         # "battle", "loot", "dance", "story", "encounter"
func export_state() -> Dictionary              # { master_seed, cursors: { name: int } }
func import_state(d: Dictionary) -> void
```

Each `RngStream` (RefCounted) wraps a `RandomNumberGenerator` seeded by `hash(master_seed, name)` and
tracks a **cursor** (number of draws taken). Drawing increments the cursor; `set_cursor(n)` replays the
stream forward to draw `n` (or the implementation reseeds and fast-forwards) so a saved cursor
**exactly** reproduces subsequent draws.

```gdscript
class RngStream:
    func randi() -> int
    func randi_range(a: int, b: int) -> int
    func chance_permille(p: int) -> bool       # p in 0..1000 (integer; no float in outcomes)
    func weighted_pick(weights: Array) -> int   # integer-weighted index (EnemyBrain, dance tables)
    func get_cursor() -> int
    func set_cursor(n: int) -> void
    # randf() exists for COSMETIC-only use on the unsaved UI stream; outcome logic uses the integer API.
```

The six saved streams are `battle` (damage/crit/accuracy/loot rolls), `ai` (EnemyBrain selection),
`loot`, `dance` (Penguin Dance table), `encounter` (encounter/enemy selection), and `story`. Keeping
`ai` separate from `battle` means enemy decision rolls never shift damage reproducibility.

- **Injection:** logic classes (`BattleEngine`, `DamageFormula`, `EnemyBrain`, loot, `PENGUIN_DANCE`)
  receive an `RngStream` as a constructor/parameter argument — never reach for a global. Tests pass a
  `FakeRng` (scripted sequence) or a fixed-seed real stream.
- **Saved with the run:** `export_state()` is stored in the save (ADR-0005) and in checkpoints/replay
  snapshots, so restoring a checkpoint or replaying an ending continues the exact same RNG.

### Determinism guarantees & rules

1. **Integer math** in all outcome-affecting formulas (ADR-0004) — damage, healing, **ATB advance and
   status `atb_modifier_permille` (turn order is an outcome)**, level/XP curves, and all probabilities
   (integer permille). No float accumulation that can diverge across Android/Chromebook/web. Floats only
   for cosmetic/animation, never for outcomes.
2. **No wall-clock / OS entropy in logic.** Logic modules must not call `Time.*`, `OS.*`, global
   `randi/randf`, or `randomize()`. A **guard test** (`tests/unit/test_no_nondeterminism.gd`) greps the
   `battle/` (incl. `enemy_ai.gd`), `story/`, `save/`, `inventory/`, `leveling/` sources and fails on
   any such reference.
3. **Stable ordering.** Turn ties, AI target ties (`lowest_hp`/`highest_threat`), and any iteration that
   affects outcomes use deterministic keys (stable indices), never `Dictionary` iteration order.
4. **Stream discipline.** Damage/accuracy/crit/loot from `"battle"`; enemy choices from `"ai"`; Piggy's
   dance from `"dance"`; encounter/enemy selection from `"encounter"`; loot tables from `"loot"`.
   Cosmetic randomness (idle wobble, particle) uses a throwaway *unsaved* UI stream that never affects
   state.

### Module-boundary guard (supports ARCHITECTURE §3)

`tests/unit/test_module_boundaries.gd` asserts logic modules don't `preload`/reference autoload
coordinators, `ui/`, or `overworld/` — keeping the headless core pure and the ≥80% target attainable.

### Must-test list (maps to DoD #4/#9/#13/#14)

- **Battle math** — damage/heal with accuracy/miss, weakness/crit/variance under fixed seed; min-1
  floor; integer stability; retarget-on-dead and fizzle.
- **Enemy AI** — `EnemyBrain` picks the expected ability+target per condition/weight/target_rule under a
  `FakeRng`; boss phase transitions at hp thresholds; `basic`/`caster`/`boss_phased` policies.
- **Encounters** — load + validate (enemy/item refs exist); flee-allowed gating; reward override.
- **Status & turn ordering** — apply/tick/expire, stack rules, Songsickness ATB penalty; ready-queue
  ordering and tie-breaks; **integer permille** haste/slow (no float).
- **Leveling & inventory** — data-authored XP→level curve, integer stat growth, caps/overrides;
  add/remove/equip/stack limits.
- **Save/load + checkpoint** — full round-trip equality (incl. `choices`/`quests`/`cooldowns`/all six
  cursors); **battle-checkpoint restore** returns to pre-battle; **migration** N→N+1 with pre-migration
  backup + post-migration re-validate; **corruption → `.bak` → checkpoint recovery** (validate-before-
  backup never destroys a good `.bak`); **replay-mode guard blocks every write path incl. lifecycle**.
- **Story graph & flags** — every ledger beat's flag/UNITY effects; UNITY monotonic + frozen at A3-13;
  **single-owner / per-source-id idempotency proves UNITY can't double-count**; each branch's outcomes
  and merge; Kestrel-recruit dependency on `KESTREL_DOUBT`; enum `final_choice`/`ending` round-trip.
- **Derived flags** — `WARDEN_TRUTH_WHOLE` (both-shards OR Rookwise+one-shard); `FACTIONS_UNITED`
  (unity≥5 AND Kestrel AND (Order OR truth)).
- **`resolveEnding` (GOLDEN, exhaustive)** — for the relevant flag/UNITY/choice combinations: Sleep→B
  and Take→C always; Share→A iff `FACTIONS_UNITED`; Wake→D iff
  `WARDEN_TRUTH_WHOLE AND ROOKWISE_RECRUITED AND MARROW_REDEEMED`; `offered_options` never lists an
  ungated option; non-gating flags (Piggy/emotional/`BRAMBLE_SACRIFICE`) provably never change a result.
- **Ending replay** — completing once unlocks B+C; reaching A4-06 with each gate satisfied unlocks A/D;
  `ReplayPlanner.build_state` (faithful and canonical) yields an **offerable, valid** A4-06 state and
  `resolve` returns the correct letter from it; **synthesized states set only underlying flags and
  derive `WARDEN_TRUTH_WHOLE`/`FACTIONS_UNITED`** (a synthesized Ending-D state has real shards +
  Rookwise + Marrow, never a directly-set derived flag) — the same validation a real run passes.
- **Determinism guards** — no `Time/OS/randi/randf` in logic; module boundaries respected.
- **Content validation** — all shipped `game/data` passes schema/reference/domain validation.

### Coverage & CI

- ≥80% line coverage on the `unit/` target modules, measured by GUT's coverage option (or a coverage
  pass over the logic dirs); reported in the PR body per `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the full suite headless on every PR; **red blocks merge**. If Actions
  minutes are unavailable, the suite is run locally (headless Godot) and the result pasted into the PR.

## Rationale

A single seeded service with named, cursor-saved substreams is the smallest design that makes battles
reproducible, checkpoints/replays exact, and every randomized system unit-testable via injection — the
backbone of DoD #9/#13/#14. Integer math and the no-clock/no-global-RNG guards prevent the subtle
cross-platform nondeterminism that would otherwise make "reproducible" untrue on one of our three
targets. The golden resolver test pins the highest-stakes logic to `04` so it can never silently drift.

## Consequences

- All randomized logic must accept an injected `RngStream`; constructing one's own RNG inside logic is a
  review-blocked anti-pattern (and caught by the guard test).
- Saving RNG cursors slightly enlarges the save and requires `set_cursor` to be exact; the
  implementation is covered by its own determinism test (same seed+cursor ⇒ same next draws).
- The 80% target is scoped to logic modules by design; UI/scene code is covered by lighter integration
  tests, keeping the bar meaningful rather than padded.
- Cosmetic randomness must use the unsaved UI stream; using a saved stream for flavor would desync
  replays and is disallowed.
